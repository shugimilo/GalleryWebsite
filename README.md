<ul><dl>
    <li>
    <dt><h4>User</h4><dt>

     - Users should be able to log in/create an account;<br>
     - After logging in,  the user can browse through the gallery/view images which are posted by special user type - Artist;<br>
     - The users should be able to rate the images (on a scale of 1 to 5) as well as leave comments on images;<br>
     - The users should also have an option to share an image of their liking;<br>
    </dd>
    </li>
